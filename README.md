This Power BI dashboard provides a complete analytical view of a superstoreâ€™s sales performance, profitability, customer behavior, and future trends. It visualizes key business metrics like total sales, profit, quantity sold, and average discount across multiple dimensions such as product category, sub-category, shipping mode, payment method, and customer segment. Users can interact with the visuals to analyze sales performance by month and year, identify high-performing product lines like Phones and Office Supplies, and compare revenue across U.S. states through a geographical heat map. The dashboard also segments data by region (Central, East, South, West), enabling more focused regional analysis.

In addition to performance analysis, the dashboard includes a forecasting view that tracks historical sales data from early 2019 to 2021 and identifies sales trends over time. Using line charts, it highlights peaks and drops in order volumes and helps predict future demand. The state-wise breakdown of sales in the forecasting view adds a layer of strategic insight for targeted planning. Overall, this dashboard empowers decision-makers with both real-time insights and forward-looking trends, making it a powerful tool for data-driven retail management.
